# SQL-Data-Exploration
SQL Query exploring the data about covid deaths, vaccinations, etc during the years of 2020-2021. Two datasets were used, which were downloaded from official website of world data, so it's pretty accurate.
The Query uses all basic things in MS SQL such as: tables, joins, temporary tables, views for future visualisation, etc.
